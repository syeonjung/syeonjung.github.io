## Hello, World! 👋

I'm **Seungyeon Jung**, a master's student in Sociology at Yonsei University. My academic journey focuses on understanding how our social environments shape our decisions and society as a whole.

### Research Interests 📚

My research lies at the intersection of:

* **Educational Sociology**
  * How educational institutions influence social mobility
  * Decision-making processes in educational choices

* **Urban Sociology**
  * Neighborhood effects on social behavior
  * Patterns of social segregation and their implications

### Current Research 🔍

I'm particularly interested in examining how different social strata make decisions influenced by their social contexts. My research explores:

* The relationship between school environments and student outcomes
* How neighborhood dynamics shape social behaviors
* The reciprocal effects between individual choices and social segregation patterns

### Projects & Collaborations 🤝

I have been involved in several research projects that explore these themes. Some highlights include:
* [Project Name 1] - Brief description
* [Project Name 2] - Brief description
