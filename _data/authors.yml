   Welcome to my website!
   My name is Seungyeon Jung, and I am a master's student in Sociology at Yonsei University.
   My research interests lie in the Sociology of Education and Urban Sociology, particularly focusing on how different social strata make decisions influenced by their social contexts (schools and neighborhoods), and how these decisions reciprocally shape patterns of social segregation.
   I have been involved in several research projects exploring these themes, which you can explore here.
   If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at: syeonj [at] yonsei.ac.kr
