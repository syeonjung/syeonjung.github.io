## Metodological Techniques

### Computational Skills
R, STATA, LaTeX, HTML, CSS

I love playing with data! ðŸŽ¨

For statistical analysis, I'm fluent in both R and STATA
I enjoy bringing data to life through visualization:

Creating interactive maps is my favorite part - I use R Shiny with CSS to make data explorable
I also have fun building websites from scratch using HTML and CSS
