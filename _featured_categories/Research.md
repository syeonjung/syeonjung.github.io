  My research investigates how individual choices and institutional structures interact to reproduce educational inequalities. I focus particularly on how neighborhood and school dynamics shape educational opportunities and outcomes. Through my studies of double major selection patterns and private supplementary education, I examine how seemingly open educational opportunities can perpetuate disparities through constrained individual choices and institutional practices. In terms of methodology, I employ advanced quantitative methods, particularly causal inference techniques like causal mediation analysis and difference-in-differences, to disentangle the complex mechanisms through which neighborhoods, schools, and family resources influence educational stratification. My current work extends this focus by examining how school choice policies, intended to reduce inequalities, may inadvertently reproduce them through the differential responses of social groups in their educational and residential decisions.
