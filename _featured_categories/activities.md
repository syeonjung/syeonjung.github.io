    <h1> KOREA INEQUALITY OPPORTUNITY DATABASE </h1>
    <p>
      A project I have mainly joined in, the Korea Inequality Opportunity Database (KIOD), 
      The KIOD (Korea Inequality Opportunity Database) currently consists of two main components: (1) Youth Higher Education Opportunity Inequality Data and (2) National Residential Segregation Data.The Youth Higher Education Opportunity Inequality Data provides various indicators of university-related opportunity inequality by district (si-gun-gu), based on microdata from the Graduates Occupational Mobility Survey (GOMS) from 2008 to 2019. The National Residential Segregation Data provides segregation indices by household type, socioeconomic status, household income, and housing type for each district, based on microdata from the Population and Housing Census (2000-2020) and the Household Travel Survey (2006, 2010).Additionally, KIOD provides maps that illustrate the geographical and spatial patterns of inequality in Korea by offering  district-level data and related materials (codebooks and analysis highlights) along with visualizations using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools.

      As a research assistant, I contributed to the development of KIOD by constructing the segregation dataset and designing interactive visualizations using RShiny and CSS. Building on this work, I am currently conducting two research projects utilizing this database. The first project employs multilevel logistic regression to analyze segregation trends across residential and activity spaces in Korea, examining how these patterns of school segregation influence college admission outcomes.
