    <h1>Longitudinal School Attendance Boundary Study</h1>
    <p>
      A project out of Penn State University, the Longitudinal School Attendance Boundary Study (LSABS), 
      is a novel data collection effort that aims to collect longitudinal data on school attendance zone 
      boundaries from school districts across the country. Co-led by Chris Fowler and Erica Frankenberg, 
      the project will lead to a database of attendance zone boundaries from 1990 to 2020, which will be 
      made available to the public for research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon completion of the project, the researchers will produce a publicly available data source that captures 
      boundary changes from 1990 to 2020 for a national sample of K-12 school districts. Among other uses, the new 
      database can help enrich our understanding of the relationship between school and housing patterns, especially 
      allowing for analysis of the changes in school and neighborhood demographics over time.
