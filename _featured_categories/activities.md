<h2> NORC at the UNIVERSITY of CHICAGO </h2>

<p>
During the summer of 2023, I interned with the National Social Life Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) team at NORC at the University of Chicago. During this internship, I conducted an independent research project examining "The Effect of Educational Homogamy on Older Adults' Health in Later Life" using NSHAP data.

Moreover, my stay in Chicago offered valuable opportunities for direct observation of the city's stark racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns across its geographic landscape, and how these spatial divisions manifest in disparate school quality between neighborhoods. These firsthand observations strengthened my research interest in understanding the complex relationships between residential segregation, neighborhood effects, and educational inequality.
