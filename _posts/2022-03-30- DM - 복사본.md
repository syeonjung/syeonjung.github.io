## Neighborhood Effects Through Private Supplementary Education

### Background
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in, and need for, various programs that allow students to select additional majors during their undergraduate careers in addition to the one they declared at the time they entered college. Existing studies have mostly analyzed the effectiveness of these programs, but few studies have examined how students come to choose a major beyond a single major.

Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between neighborhood context (treatment A), private supplementary education (mediator M), and academic performance (outcome Y). The model includes individual characteristics (baseline confounder C) and school quality (exposure-induced confounder Z). Neighborhood effects operate through two pathways. The direct pathway (A → Y and A → Z → Y) shows neighborhood effects independent of private supplementary education. The indirect pathway (A → M → Y and A → Z → M → Y) demonstrates how neighborhoods influence academic performance through private supplementary education. Total effects can be decomposed into these pathways even with exposure-mediator interaction (VanderWeele, 2015).
Two potential confounders require attention. First, individual characteristics (C) like family income and parent's education must be controlled to account for residential sorting. Second, school quality (Z) represents exposure-induced confounding (Wodtke & Zhou 2019), as it affects both private supplementary education and outcomes while being influenced by neighborhood context. Analyses of time-varying exposures, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status, are complicated by the presence of exposure-induced confounders. These are variables influenced by prior exposures that, in turn, may influence future exposures and outcomes. For instance, in examining how neighborhood socioeconomic status affects academic performance through private supplementary education, school quality can be shaped by neighborhood conditions while simultaneously confounding or moderating the effect of subsequent neighborhood contexts on academic outcomes.

Exposure-induced confounders pose significant methodological challenges. If left uncontrolled, they introduce bias by conflating the effects of the exposure and the confounder. On the other hand, controlling for them naively using conventional methods can block causal pathways, leading to biased estimates of the direct and indirect effects of the exposure. This dual challenge creates a methodological conundrum for researchers attempting to disentangle the causal mechanisms in longitudinal analyses of neighborhood effects and their mediating processes.Proper adjustment for these confounders, particularly exposure-induced confounding, is crucial for unbiased estimation. This study employs the RWR (regression-with-residuals) method to address these methodological challenges.
