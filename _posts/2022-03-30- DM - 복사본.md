## Double Major As A Second Chance

### Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in, and need for, various programs that allow students to select additional majors during their undergraduate careers in addition to the one they declared at the time they entered college. Existing studies have mostly analyzed the effectiveness of these programs, but few studies have examined how students come to choose a major beyond a single major. Using data from the Graduate Occupational Mobility Survey and sequential logit models, we examine how the decision to double major and choose a high-reward major varies by gender, family socioeconomic status, and prior achievement status (original major and college characteristics). Our findings are fourfold. First, children of highly educated parents and those who attended selective colleges were more likely to double major. Second, while non-STEM majors were more likely to double major, the likelihood of choosing a high-reward major when double majoring was higher for STEM majors and high-reward majors. Third, overall, family capital (parental education, household income) and educational capital (selective college) helped students use double majoring more aggressively to compensate for an unfavorable primary major. Fourth, women are more likely to double major, and this is especially true for women in STEM majors. On the other hand, women in STEM majors at selective universities are significantly less likely to choose a high-reward major. These results suggest that the choice of a double major is stratified by the motivation to compensate for pre-existing disadvantage, with better family capital and educational capital contributing significantly to inequality. The results also raise the possibility that double majoring is used as an exit route for women in STEM majors at selective universities into non-STEM majors with lower expected rewards.

our research employs a sequential logit model to analyze double major selection processes. This implies that we assume double major selection occurs in two stages, as shown in [Figure 1]. In the first stage, students consider whether to pursue a double major program. Then, if they decide to pursue a double major, they move to the second stage where they decide which major to choose. More specifically, they decide whether to select a major that promises high benefits in the labor market or one that does not.
Setting up double major selection as a two-stage process offers two important advantages. First, through this two-stage decision framework, we can analyze both cases where students make their choices with a prospective view of potential benefits from double majoring, as well as cases where they choose double majors for other reasons. By examining the differences between the first-stage choice (whether to pursue a double major) and the second-stage choice (whether to choose a high-expected-benefit major), we can identify which characteristics are associated with respondents making or not making benefit-based choices (Buis, 2010). Second, this framework can reflect the concept of bounded rationality, acknowledging that benefit-based rational decisions are not made with perfect information, but rather through respondents' rough categorization of majors as either 'promising' or not.
