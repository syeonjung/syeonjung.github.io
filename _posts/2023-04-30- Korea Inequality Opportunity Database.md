## KOREA INEQUALITY OPPORTUNITY DATABASE 

<p>
A project I have mainly joined in, KIOD (Korea Inequality Opportunity Database) currently consists of two main components: (1) Youth higher education opportunity inequality data and (2) national segregation data. As a research assistant, I contributed to the development of KIOD by constructing the segregation dataset and designing interactive visualizations using RShiny and CSS. In addition to these data sources, my dataset about private supplementary education, set for my master's thesis, will also be published in KIOD database.

One main purpose of my work is:
(1) to figure out how much people are segregated not only by their social class, housing types, family structures but also activity spaces.
(2) to show how inequalities happen and draw a discussion about spatial inequalities based on empirical findings and data sources.

Building on this work, I am currently conducting two research projects utilizing this database. The first project employs multilevel logistic regression to analyze segregation trends across residential and activity spaces in South Korea, examining how these patterns of school segregation influence college admission outcomes. In addition to the research, I am very interested in visualizing the works via interactive maps, where all can access and interpret easily!
