## Neighborhood Effects Through Private Supplementary Education

### Background
Over the past decades, the academic achievement gap between neighborhoods in SOuth Korea has steadily widened. To uncover the causes of these regional educational disparities, unequal educational quality within neighborhoods, particularly the disparate quality of private supplementary education across different areas, has been identified as a major concern. However, contrary to these discussions, most studies have only recognized private supplementary education as an inequality resource at the individual level, while  few research has examined whether it actually explains educational inequality between neighborhoods. This study aimed to investigate the influence of private supplementary education beyond individual academic achievement at the community level.
