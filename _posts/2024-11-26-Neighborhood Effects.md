description: >
  My research investigates how individual choices and institutional structures interact to reproduce educational inequalities. I focus particularly on how neighborhood and school dynamics shape educational opportunities and outcomes. Through my studies of double major selection patterns and private supplementary education, I examine how seemingly open educational opportunities can perpetuate disparities through constrained individual choices and institutional practices. In terms of methodology, I employ advanced quantitative methods, particularly causal inference techniques like causal mediation analysis and difference-in-differences, to disentangle the complex mechanisms through which neighborhoods, schools, and family resources influence educational stratification. My current work extends this focus by examining how school choice policies, intended to reduce inequalities, may inadvertently reproduce them through the differential responses of social groups in their educational and residential decisions.

# Neighborhood Effects Through Private Supplementary Education

# Background
Over the past decades, the academic achievement gap between neighborhoods in SOuth Korea has steadily widened. To uncover the causes of these regional educational disparities, unequal educational quality within neighborhoods, particularly the disparate quality of private supplementary education across different areas, has been identified as a major concern. However, contrary to these discussions, most studies have only recognized private supplementary education as an inequality resource at the individual level, while  few research has examined whether it actually explains educational inequality between neighborhoods. This study aimed to investigate the influence of private supplementary education beyond individual academic achievement at the community level.
